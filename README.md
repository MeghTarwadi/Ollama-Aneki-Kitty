## Configuration

The configuration file is located at `saves/default/config.conf`. Here are some key settings:

```ini
# Appearance settings
alert = [red]                # Color for alerts
asciiart = [yellow]          # Color for ASCII art  
normal = [white]             # Default text color
highlight = [blue]           # Color for highlighted text
box_borders = DOUBLE         # Box style: DOUBLE, HEAVY, SIMPLE, ROUNDED, SQUARE
box_width = 0                # Terminal width (0 = auto)

# Behavior settings
auto_clear = 1               # Clear terminal automatically (1 = yes, 0 = no)
emotion_generation = 1       # Enable emotion visualization (1 = yes, 0 = no)
exit_code = die              # Command to exit conversation
memory_length = 10           # Number of messages to keep in memory

# Content settings
pngfolder = Aneki            # Emotion style ("Aneki", "Makima", "Makima white background")
custom_path = saves/custom   # Custom data storage location
```

## Customization

### Adding Custom Emotions

Place your PNG files in the `saves/custom/exp/` directory with the emotion name as filename (e.g., `happy.png`).

### Creating Custom ASCII Art

1. Edit the ASCII art files in `saves/default/ascii1.txt` or `saves/default/ascii2.txt`
2. Run `aneki asciiart` to merge the arts
3. Your custom art will appear in the banner
