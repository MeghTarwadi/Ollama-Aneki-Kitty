## Installation

### Prerequisites

* **Terminal:** Kitty terminal for best experience (supports `icat` for PNG display)
* **Python:** Python 3.6 or higher
* **Ollama:** Must be installed and configured on your system

### Quick Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/MeghTarwadi/ollama-aneki-kitty.git

# Navigate to the directory
cd ollama-aneki-kitty

# Run the setup script
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

The setup script will:

1. Create a virtual environment for dependencies
2. Install required Python packages
3. Set up necessary directories and configuration files
4. Create a system-wide executable command (`aneki`)

After installation, you can run the `aneki` command from anywhere in your terminal!

## Usage

### Basic Commands

* `aneki` - Launch the main interface
* `aneki run [model_name]` - Run a specific model
* `aneki new` - Create a new custom model
* `aneki history` - View past model configurations
* `aneki help` - Display help information
* `aneki asciiart` - Merge ASCII arts for custom display

### Creating a Custom Model

1. Run `aneki new`
2. Enter base model name (e.g., `phi3.5`)
3. Choose a name for your custom model
4. Set behavior instructions for your model
5. Optionally add information to your model's memory

### Chat Management

* Inside a conversation, type your exit code (default: `die`) to quit
* Use `aneki run read` to view past conversations
* Use `aneki run cont` to continue a previous conversation

### Quitting Properly

* To exit a conversation: type your exit code (default: `die`)
* To interrupt the program: press `Ctrl+C` - this will safely exit and return you to your original directory

## Configuration

The configuration file is located at `saves/default/config.conf`. Here are some key settings:

```ini
# Appearance settings
alert = [red]                # Color for alerts
asciiart = [yellow]          # Color for ASCII art  
normal = [white]             # Default text color
highlight = [blue]           # Color for highlighted text
box_borders = DOUBLE         # Box style: DOUBLE, HEAVY, SIMPLE, ROUNDED, SQUARE
box_width = 0                # Terminal width (0 = auto)

# Behavior settings
auto_clear = 1               # Clear terminal automatically (1 = yes, 0 = no)
emotion_generation = 1       # Enable emotion visualization (1 = yes, 0 = no)
exit_code = die              # Command to exit conversation
memory_length = 10           # Number of messages to keep in memory

# Content settings
pngfolder = Aneki            # Emotion style ("Aneki", "Makima", "Makima white background")
custom_path = saves/custom   # Custom data storage location
```

## Customization

### Adding Custom Emotions

Place your PNG files in the `saves/custom/exp/` directory with the emotion name as filename (e.g., `happy.png`).

### Creating Custom ASCII Art

1. Edit the ASCII art files in `saves/default/ascii1.txt` or `saves/default/ascii2.txt`
2. Run `aneki asciiart` to merge the arts
3. Your custom art will appear in the banner

## Uninstallation

```bash
# Remove the executable
sudo rm /usr/local/bin/aneki

# Remove the directory (optional)
